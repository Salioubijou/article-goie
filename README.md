# The Generalized Odd Inverted Exponential-G family ofDistributions:  Properties and Applications

### Abstract.
In this article, we introduce a new family of distributions, called the generalized odd invertedexponential-G family.  Its main feature is to use a new flexible generalization of the so-called odd trans-formation  based  on  a  weighting  technique.   We  study  some  of  its  mathematical  properties  such  thatasymptotic, quantile function, linear representation, moments, reliability, entropy, order statistics and bi-variate  extension.   Then,  the  inferential  aspect  of  the  corresponding  statistical  model  is  explored.   Themaximum likelihood estimation of the parameters is discussed and a Monte Carlo simulation study showsthe good performances of the obtained estimates.  The usefulness and flexibility of the new family of distri-butions is demonstrated through three practical data sets.  It is shown that some generalized odd invertedexponential-G special models can outperform well-established models in the literature.2010 Mathematics Subject Classifications:  60E05; 62E15; 62F10.Key Words and Phrases:  Inverted exponential distribution; odd transformation; maximum likelihoodestimation; data analysis.
